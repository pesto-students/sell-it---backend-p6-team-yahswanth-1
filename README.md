# Sell-It


Sell-it is a plateform that buys your second-hand product with a fee, refurbished it, and then sell it for a profit. You don’t have to wait for a long time. We’ll inspect your good. We’ll pick the good. We’ll pay you.

# Technology Stack
We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.dev/en/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [JSON web tokens](https://jwt.io/)
* [Winston (File loggers)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston)
